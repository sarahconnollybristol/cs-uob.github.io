This unit will acquaint students with a collection of tools and frameworks that are used when undertaking large software development projects. It will support their group project work in COMSM1401 Software Engineering and Group Project, where they work in groups to create software that solves a problem for a real client, as well as preparing them for software development roles in their future career.

### In particular, the unit will focus on the following areas:

- **Effective software development workflow and associated tools**, for example the command line, version control, build and dependency management systems.
- **Development tools**, for example editors and integrated development environments, compilers and linkers, debuggers and profilers.
- **Effective development techniques**, for example unit and integration testing, static analysis, continuous integration and deployment.
- **Relational databases and the SQL language.**
- **The web**: principles, protocols and languages (HTTP, REST; HTML, CSS), architecture of web applications.
- **The cloud**: what it is, how to use it, overview and features of one or more cloud providers.

This unit builds on and complements the unit COMSM1201 Programming in C taken in the previous teaching block and aligns with the teaching of object-oriented programming in unit Object-Oriented Programming with Java.

### Intended learning outcomes  
After successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

- Use professional software development tools and workflows.
- Automate the process of building and testing software.
- Improve the quality of your own software through methods including debugging and testing.
- Develop web-based, data-driven applications.
- Apply principles and practices of database design.
- Employ relevant database technologies.
- Identify and compare the features of cloud computing systems.
