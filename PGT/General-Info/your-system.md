# Recommended System

### Why recommend a specific system?
For this course, you will be using a variety of bespoke software which has subtle behaviour differences accross operating systems. These changes in behaviour need to be removed so that your work can be assessed, which is why we insist that you have access to a [linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) environment. We provide in-person as well as remote access to the lab machines which are equipped with a Linux environment, but most students choose to use their personal computers for convenience. It is for this reason that we provide guidance to anyone wondering what would be best for the course.  

### Ubuntu
If your laptop is running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), you will be compatible with all of the software required to complete this course. There are many *flavours* of linux operating systems out there, but Ubuntu is very common and easy to use/install. Installing Ubuntu on your machine will completely remove the existing operating system and all files to replace them with Ubuntu. This is very straightforward and instructions can be found for non-Mac computers [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview). For Macs, find the isntructions [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview), although be warned that using Ubuntu on a Mac computer is known to be much less reliable and often it is not possible to install.

### Do I need Ubuntu?
No - you only need to have **access** to a linux environment, which the University provides.

### General Advice
There is no perfect machine for this course, but the general rule is that machines running Ubuntu are highly compatible, Windows machines and Macs with intel processors (pre-M1) are fine, and Macs with M1 or more recent processors are the most difficult/least compatible. If your personal machine is a Mac with an M1 or more recent processor and you are wondering if it would be worth spending money on a different machine, it might be worth purchasing a cheap second hand laptop and installing Ubuntu on it. High processing power/graphics are of little use to this course.
