Welcome to the website for the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bristol.

<div style="color:forestgreen">

<strong>This page is now showing units for the 2022-23 academic year. Links to individual units will be updated as unit pages go live over the coming weeks.</strong>

<em>Current students looking for last year's units should consult the 2021-22-final tag on the github page.</em>

</div>

This page will provide links to the unit pages for all units in the department who have chosen to create a website, as well as the unit catalogue page that contains the official information on topics like credit points and assessments.

Some units have chosen to host their information on the university's Blackboard content management system. These are marked with `(*)` and, depending on the set-up, might only work if you are already logged in to Blackboard and only if you are registered on the unit. You can log in to blackboard at [ole.bris.ac.uk](https://ole.bris.ac.uk).

For undergraduate students picking their optional units for future years, we have created [an interactive prerequisite map](FACE/index.html). All information on this page is offered "without warranty" as the information is subject to change in future years.

**Are you a current student with good grades, interested in a funded PhD scheme that lets you stay in Bristol and get teaching as well as research experience? Then have a look at our [Doctoral Training Associate](PGR/2022_DTA.md) positions.**

# Year 1

All these units are worth 20CP (credit points) each. The unit code numbering is not meant to make any sense, apart from the first digit being the year of study.

# Year 3, Teaching Block 1

Single honours computer science students pick five units, of which two are assessed in term (worth 15 CP each) and three are assessed in January (worth 10 CP each). As a result, each unit has three codes, one for the teaching unit (where the unit material will be) and one each for the in-term and January assessments. Some units only exist in one of the two assessment forms, these have only two codes.

Students who are not single honours CS should check with their programme director for details, but typically they can only take the 10 credit versions of units, with a January assessment.

# Year 4, Teaching Block 1

MEng and MSci CS students take five of the following units in year 4. The rules are the same as for year 3: two units assessed in-term at 15 CP each, three units assessed in January at 10 CP each.
Some units only offer a January assessment option.

# Year 3 and 4, Teaching Block 2 - project units

In this teaching block, CS project units take place. Single-honours BSc students take the 40CP "Individual Project" (COMS30045) in year 3. Single-honours MEng students take the 40CP "Team Project" (COMS30043) in year 3 and the 40CP "Individual project with Innovation Case" (COMSM0052) in year 4. All maths and computer science students choose between the CS-focused "Short Individual Project" (COMS30044) and the maths-focused "Project 1" (MATH32200) in year 3; both are 20CP, but the maths option is TB4. In year 4, MEng students who took MATH32200 then go on to take the single-honours year 4 CS project COMSM0052, while students who took COMS30044 go on to take the normal single-honours year 4 maths project MATHM2204; both are 40CP, but again the maths option is TB4. All other joint honours students have their own project units, which aren't administered by CS.

Here are the web pages for all the CS-run project units; note that for maths/CS students, we run the CS options COMS30044 and COMSM0052 but not the maths options MATH32200 and MATHM2204.

There is one exception to the above - students on the MEng can switch to the MSci at the end of second year to take three 20CP mini-project units instead of one mini-project and the team project in year 3. However you are advised to talk to a tutor before making this decision as it has implications, for example you may not be able to leave with a BSc after three years as you do not have a 40CP project "for honours".

# Year 3 and 4, Teaching Block 2

These units are all 20CP and assessed by coursework, also known as mini-project units. Each student takes one of these in year 3 and MEng students take another unit in year 4. The exception are MSci students who take three units in Year 3 and one more in Year 4.

Students must enrol on the teaching unit and on the correct assessment unit for their year, as the Year 3 assessment is not the same as the Year 4 one. You also cannot take the Year 4 assessment of a unit that you've already done in Year 3.
